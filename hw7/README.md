Hi, Everyone! Welcome to my repo for Homework07.

## Homework07 task

**Big picture**

+ Write (or extract from a previous analysis) three or more R scripts to carry out a small data analysis.

+ The output of the first script must be the input of the second, and so on.

+ Something like this:

    *First script: download some data.*
    
    *Second script: read the data, perform some analysis and write numerical data to file in CSV or TSV format.*
    
    *Third script: read the output of the second script, generate some figures and save them to files.*
    
    *Fourth script: an Rmd, actually, that presents original data, the statistical summaries, and/or the figures in a little report.*
    
    *A fifth script to rule them all, i.e. to run the others in sequence.*
    *You can use Make, Remake or (if you feel the urge for something more) a combinantion of Make and Remake.*
