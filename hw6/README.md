## Report 

The task 1 is interesting and I learned many functions in [string](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/strings.html).
I spent many time to finish task 1. And I still do not know how to get the right document to GitHub. If I do not select html_document, it will show error below; And if I decide to use html_document, it will have many messy HTML outputs. Maybe it is better to download my repo and see the HTML result for task 1.

```
Error: Functions that produce HTML output found in document targeting markdown_github-ascii_identifiers output.
Please change the output type of this document to HTML. Alternatively, you can allow
HTML output in non-HTML formats by adding this option to the YAML front-matter of
your rmarkdown file:

  always_allow_html: yes
```

Here I found some useful links for this homework.

Another question is that I try to use quadratic regression in my function, but I do not found any command which will match quadratic regression in `geom_smooth(method = "")`.
