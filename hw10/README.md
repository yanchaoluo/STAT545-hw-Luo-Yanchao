## Big picture

+ Make API queries “by hand” using httr. :heavy_check_mark:

*GET() data from the API and convert it into a clean and tidy data frame. Store that as a file ready for (hypothetical!) downstream analysis. Do just enough basic exploration of the resulting data, possibly including some plots, that you and a reader are convinced you’ve successfully downloaded and cleaned it.*

+ Use an R package that wraps an API, such as the many from rOpenSci.:heavy_check_mark:

*Scrape a multi-record dataset off the web! Convert it into a clean and tidy data frame. Store that as a file ready for (hypothetical!) downstream analysis. Do just enough basic exploration of the resulting data, possibly including some plots, that you and a reader are convinced you’ve successfully downloaded and cleaned it.*

+ Scrape the web. :heavy_check_mark:

*Prompt 1: Combine gapminder and data from geonames. Install the geonames package (on CRAN, on GitHub). Make a user account and use geonames to access data about the world’s countries. Use data from geonames and gapminder to investigate either of these questions:*

*Consider the following graph of population against time*

## Report My Process

+ This homework is beneficial, especially for future data analysis.

+ I have many final this week, so I did not have enough time to do this homework. However, I try my best to explore all the three basic tasks material. I spent many times on how to replaces all unuseful strings to empty-space and finally, I found that [gsub link](http://www.endmemo.com/program/R/gsub.php) could solve this problem.

+ In addition, I try to conbine `rebird` and `rplos`, but I cannot figure it out. I will keep it and try to do after the final exam.

+ Stat 545 and Stat 547 are wonderful courses for R, and I learned a lot in this courses. Thanks all instructors, TAs, and classmates for helping me.
