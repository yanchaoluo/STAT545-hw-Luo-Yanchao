## Load the data

library(tidyverse)
library(forcats)
library(singer)
library(reshape2)
library(RColorBrewer)
library(dplyr)
library(grid)
```

## Factor management

**Step goals:**

+ Define factor variables;
+ Drop factor / levels;
+ Reorder levels based on knowledge from data.

I choose the Joey’s Singer data. 

#### Factorise 
*Transform some of the variable in the singer_locations dataframe into factors: pay attention at what levels you introduce and their order. Try and consider the difference between the base R as.factor and the forcats-provided functions.*

#### Factor inspection

```{r}
singer_locations


str(singer_locations)
nrow(singer_locations)
length(unique(singer_locations$artist_name))
length(unique(singer_locations$name))
length(unique(singer_locations$artist_id))

```

From the R output above. `str(singer_locations)` shows that no variable is vector. And `nrow(singer_locations)` shows that there are 10100 rows in total.  I found unique of `artist_id`, `artist_name`,`name` are less than total `nrows`, so I want to factorize `artist_id`, `artist_name`,`name`.

Using `as.factor`.

```{r}
newsinger_locations <- singer_locations %>%
  mutate(factor_name = as.factor(singer_locations$name), 
         factor_artist_name = as.factor(singer_locations$artist_name), 
         factor_artist_id = as.factor(singer_locations$artist_id))
head(newsinger_locations)
```


Using `forcats`
```
newsinger_locations2 <- singer_locations %>%
  mutate(factor_name = as_factor(singer_locations$name),
         factor_artist_name = as_factor(singer_locations$artist_name), 
         factor_artist_id = as_factor(singer_locations$artist_id)) 
head(newsinger_locations2)
```

At this time, the `as_factor` does not work. So I checked the data and found that the reason of not working may be due to many `NA` in the data.

Check the "NA"
```{r}
if(sum(is.na(singer_locations$name)!=0)) print("variable `name` has NA")
if(sum(is.na(singer_locations$artist_name)!=0)) print("variable `artist_name` has NA")
if(sum(is.na(singer_locations$artist_id)!=0)) print("variable `artist_id` has NA")
```

From the code above, I found variable `name` has "NA"s.

Assign "no information" for "NA".
```{r}
newsinger_locations3 <- singer_locations %>%
  mutate(name= ifelse(is.na(name), "no information", singer_locations$name)) %>% 
  mutate(factor_name = as_factor(name), 
         factor_artist_name = as_factor(artist_name),
         factor_artist_id = as_factor(artist_id))
head(newsinger_locations3)
```

The `as_factor` worked after we have removed the "NA"s. 

+ Name

```{r}
nlevels(newsinger_locations$factor_name)
nlevels(newsinger_locations3$factor_name)
head(levels(newsinger_locations$factor_name))
head(levels(newsinger_locations3$factor_name))
```

+ artist_name

Compare nlevels between `as.factor` and `as_factor`.
```{r}
nlevels(newsinger_locations$factor_artist_name)
nlevels(newsinger_locations3$factor_artist_name)
head(levels(newsinger_locations$factor_artist_name))
head(levels(newsinger_locations3$factor_artist_name))
```

+ artist_id
```{r}
nlevels(newsinger_locations$factor_artist_id)
nlevels(newsinger_locations3$factor_artist_id)
head(levels(newsinger_locations$factor_artist_id))
head(levels(newsinger_locations3$factor_artist_id))

```

Actually,`as_factor`creates levels in order in which they appear, and it will be the same as the original data. On the other hand, 
`as.factor` will change the levels order of the factor. 
Therefore, if there is no "NA"s `as_factor` is better than `as.factor `, because it will keep the data's original order. 

#### Drop 0

*Filter the singer_locations data to remove observations associated with the uncorrectly inputed  year 0. Additionally, remove unused factor levels. Provide concrete information on the data before and after removing these rows and levels; address the number of rows and the levels of the affected factors.*

Using the new dataset `newsinger_locations3`

```{r}
Check_0<-newsinger_locations3 %>%
  filter(year==0) 

nrow(Check_0)
```

We had 100 observations which the "year" equal to "0".

`droplevels()` operates on all the factors in a data frame or on a single factor.

```{r}
remove_0 <- newsinger_locations3 %>%
  filter(year != 0) %>%
  droplevels()
nrow(remove_0)
```

There are 100 rows have been removed compared with the previous data.

Checked how many levels changed after removing "0".

+ name
```{r}
nlevels(remove_0$factor_name)

nlevels(newsinger_locations3$factor_name)-nlevels(remove_0$factor_name)

```

We used to have 2913 levels of variable `name`, and left 2879 levels after removing "0". So it totally reduced 34 levels.

+ artist_name

```{r}
nlevels(remove_0$factor_artist_name)

nlevels(newsinger_locations3$factor_artist_name)-nlevels(remove_0$factor_artist_name)

```

We used to have 7498 levels of variable `name`, and left 7408 levels after removing "0". So it totally  reduced 90 levels.

+ artist_id

```{r}
nlevels(remove_0$factor_artist_id)

nlevels(newsinger_locations3$factor_artist_id)-nlevels(remove_0$factor_artist_id)

```

We used to have 7346 levels of variable `name`, and left 7258 levels after removing "0". So it totally  reduced 88 levels.

```{r}
table <- data.frame( nlevels(newsinger_locations3$factor_name), nlevels(remove_0$factor_name), nlevels(newsinger_locations3$factor_artist_name), nlevels(remove_0$factor_artist_name), nlevels(newsinger_locations3$factor_artist_id), nlevels(remove_0$factor_artist_id))
names(table) <- c("`name` before", "`name` after ", "`artist_name` before", "`artist_name` after","`artist_id` before","`artist_id` after")
knitr::kable(table)
```

#### Reorder the levels of year, artist_name or title.

*Use the forcats package to change the order of the factor levels, based on a principled summary of one of the quantitative variables. Consider experimenting with a summary statistic beyond the most basic choice of the median.*

Factor variables  `artist_name` `year` `title`.
```{r}
newsinger_locations4 <- singer_locations %>%
  mutate(factor_artist_name = as_factor(artist_name),
         factor_title = as_factor(title))
```

+ Reorder the `title` by another variable `artist_hotttnesss  `.

(1) Original order

```{r}
head(levels(newsinger_locations4$factor_title))
```

(2) Order the mean value instead of median value and using backwards.

```{r}
fct_reorder(newsinger_locations4$factor_title, newsinger_locations4$artist_hotttnesss, mean, desc = TRUE) %>% 
  levels() %>%  head() 
```

The levels of `title` are reordered, so that the mean of artist_hotttnesss are in descending order. 

+ Reorder the `artist_name` by another variable `artist_hotttnesss`

(1) Original order

```{r}
head(levels(newsinger_locations4$factor_artist_name))
```

(2) Order the minimum value of artist_hotttnesss.

```{r}
fct_reorder(newsinger_locations4$factor_artist_name, newsinger_locations4$artist_hotttnesss, min) %>% 
  levels() %>%  head()
```

The levels of `artist_name` are reordered follow by the minimum of artist_hotttnesss. 

#### Common part:


*Characterize the (derived) data before and after your factor re-leveling.*

*Explore the effects of arrange(). Does merely arranging the data have any effect on, say, a figure?*
*Explore the effects of reordering a factor and factor reordering coupled with arrange(). Especially, what effect does this have on a figure?*

+ Using `arrange` function to see how to change the factor `title` and `artist_name`.

Because the data is so large, I want to consider subset of data(only see the artist_hotttnesss larger than 0.840 ). 

Plot before `arrange`.
```{r}

newsinger_locations4 %>% 
  filter(artist_hotttnesss>0.840) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=factor_artist_name,y=artist_hotttnesss)) + 
  geom_point(aes(colour=artist_name)) +
 labs(y="artist_hotttnesss", 
          x="artist_name",
          title=" Using `arrange` to compare factor_artist_name based on artist_hotttnesss")+
  theme_bw()+
  theme( axis.title = element_text(size=14))
```


```{r}

newsinger_locations4 %>% 
  arrange(artist_hotttnesss) %>% 
  filter(artist_hotttnesss>0.840) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=factor_artist_name,y=artist_hotttnesss)) + 
  geom_point(aes(colour=artist_name)) +
 labs(y="artist_hotttnesss", 
          x="artist_name",
          title=" Using `arrange` to compare factor_artist_name based on artist_hotttnesss")+
  theme_bw()+
  theme( axis.title = element_text(size=14))
```

We can see that `arrange` does not has any effect on the plots, and the levels are the same as before and after arranged.

+ Using `reordering` function to see how the factor `title` and `artist_name`changed.

```{r}

newsinger_locations4 %>% 
  filter(artist_hotttnesss>0.840) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=fct_reorder(factor_artist_name, artist_hotttnesss,max,desc = TRUE),y=artist_hotttnesss)) + 
  geom_point(aes(colour=artist_name)) +
 labs( y="artist_hotttnesss", 
          x="artist_name",
          title=" Using ``reorder` to arrange factor_artist_name based on artist_hotttnesss")+
  theme_bw()+
  theme( axis.title = element_text(size=14))
```

Using `reorder` often makes plots much better. We could see who is the most popular artist and how hot he is.


+ Using `reorder` and `arrange` function to see how the factor `title` and `artist_name` changed.

```{r}
newsinger_locations4 %>% 
  arrange(artist_hotttnesss) %>% 
  filter(artist_hotttnesss>0.840) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=fct_reorder(factor_artist_name, artist_hotttnesss,max,desc = TRUE),y=artist_hotttnesss)) + 
  geom_point(aes(colour=artist_name)) +
 labs(y="artist_hotttnesss", 
          x="artist_name",
          title=" Compare the  factor_artist_name based on artist_hotttnesss")+
  theme_bw()+
  theme( axis.title = element_text(size=14))

```
`arrange()` does not change the order of the levels and has no effect on the plots.
There is no change for the above plot compared with the graph, which only uses `reorder` function.

## File I/O

*Experiment with one or more of `write_csv()`/`read_csv()` (and/or TSV friends), `saveRDS()`/`readRDS()`,  `dput()`/`dget()`. Create something new, probably by filtering or grouped-summarization of Singer or Gapminder. I highly recommend you fiddle with the factor levels, i.e. make them non-alphabetical (see previous section). Explore whether this survives the round trip of writing to file then reading back in.*

#### Using `write_csv` and `read_csv()`.
```{r}
## When year larger than 2009, summary the maximum of hotness for each artist.
artist_hotttnesss_max <- newsinger_locations4 %>%
  select(year,factor_artist_name,artist_hotttnesss) %>%
  filter(year>2009) %>%
  group_by(factor_artist_name) %>% 
  summarise(max_artist_hotttnesss=max(artist_hotttnesss))
```

```{r}
readr::write_csv(artist_hotttnesss_max, "artist_hotttnesss")
```

```{r}
head(readr::read_csv("artist_hotttnesss"))
str(readr::read_csv("artist_hotttnesss"))
```

I found that `artist_name` is considered as a character instead of factor, when using `read_csv` functions.

#### Using `saveRDS()` and `readRDS()` 

`saveRDS()` serializes an R object to a binary file.
`saveRDS()` has more arguments, in particular compress for controlling compression, so I read the help for more advanced usage. 

```{r}
saveRDS(artist_hotttnesss_max, "artist_hotttnesss_max.rds")
artist_hotttnesss_max1<-readRDS("artist_hotttnesss_max.rds")
str(artist_hotttnesss_max1)
```

I found that we have changed the `artist_name` to be a factor at this time.

#### Using `dput()`/`dget()`

```{r}
dput(artist_hotttnesss_max, "artist_hotttnesss_max_dput.txt")
artist_hotttnesss_max2 <- dget("artist_hotttnesss_max_dput.txt")
str(artist_hotttnesss_max2)
```

Using `dget` will change  the `artist_name` to be a factor. 
There is no difference between `dget()` and `saveRDS()` at this time.

#### Testing whether reordering levels of `artist_name` after reading in and out:

```{r}

newsinger_locations_test <- singer_locations %>%
  mutate(factor_artist_name = as_factor(artist_name),
         factor_title = as_factor(title))
head(levels(newsinger_locations_test$factor_artist_name))

newsinger_locations_test$factor_artist_name<-fct_reorder(newsinger_locations_test$factor_artist_name,newsinger_locations_test$artist_hotttnesss,max)

head(levels(newsinger_locations_test$factor_artist_name))

```

We could find that `artist_name` are changed by `artist_hotttnesss`. So I save it to file,and reopen it to see whether the order is changed or not.

+ `write_csv` and `read_csv`

```{r}
write_csv(newsinger_locations_test, "reorder_singer_locations.csv")
reorder_singer_locations_csv <- read_csv("reorder_singer_locations.csv")
reorder_singer_locations_csv$factor_artist_name <- as.factor(reorder_singer_locations_csv$factor_artist_name)
head(levels(reorder_singer_locations_csv$factor_artist_name))
```

Note that the order of output should not reorder the levels.

+ `saveRDS` and `readRDS`
```{r}
saveRDS(newsinger_locations_test, "reorder_newsinger_locations_test.rds")
reorder_singer_locations_rds <- readRDS("reorder_newsinger_locations_test.rds")
head(levels(reorder_singer_locations_rds$factor_artist_name))
```

We can see that how reordering works using `saveRDS` / `readRDS`.

+ `dput()`/`dget()`
```{r}
dput(newsinger_locations_test, "reorder_newsinger_locations_test.txt")
reorder_singer_locations_txt <- dget("reorder_newsinger_locations_test.txt")
head(levels(reorder_singer_locations_txt$factor_artist_name))
```

We can see that how reordering works using `dput()`/`dget()`.

```{r}
artist_name_level <- tibble(original = head(levels(newsinger_locations_test$factor_artist_name)))
artist_name_level <- artist_name_level %>% 
  mutate(use_csv = head(levels(reorder_singer_locations_csv$factor_artist_name)),
         use_rds = head(levels(reorder_singer_locations_rds$factor_artist_name)),
         use_txt = head(levels(reorder_singer_locations_txt$factor_artist_name)))
knitr::kable(artist_name_level)
```

Note that compared with the original levels, post-reordering country factor levels are restored by using the `saveRDS()` / `readRDS()` and `dput()`/`dget()` strategy. But they should be reverted to alphabetical ordering by using `write_csv()` / `read_csv()`.


## Visualization design

*Remake at least one figure or create a new one, in light of something you learned in the recent class meetings about visualization design and color. Maybe juxtapose your first attempt and what you obtained after some time spent working on it. Reflect on the differences.*

I am interested in `hotttnesss` for different artists and their hottness `duration` as the time change. 
Randomly picked an artist "Cannibal Corpse" to highlight her/his `duration`.

#### The first graph:

```{r}


colour_layer <- scale_colour_manual("", 
                        labels=c("Other artist", "Cannibal Corpse"),
                        values=c("black", "red"))
                        
 p<-newsinger_locations4%>% 
   filter(year>1980) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(year, duration))+
  geom_line(aes(group=factor_artist_name,
                color=factor_artist_name=="Cannibal Corpse",
                alpha=factor_artist_name=="Cannibal Corpse"))+
    colour_layer +
    scale_alpha_discrete(range=c(0.1, 1),
                         guide=FALSE)+
 labs(x="year", 
          y="duration",
          title="duration as the time change")+
  theme_bw()+
  theme( axis.title = element_text(size=14))
 p
```

#### The second graphs:

First I try to subset the data, only looked at the hotness larger than 0.6 and the year after 1999. The I plot the ` factor_artist_name` vs related `artist_hotttnesss`. By the same time, colored the `year` and scaled artists `familiarity`.

```{r}
newsinger_locations4 %>% 
   arrange(artist_hotttnesss) %>% 
   mutate(factor_artist_name = fct_reorder(factor_artist_name, artist_hotttnesss,max, desc = TRUE)) %>%
  filter(artist_hotttnesss>0.6, year>1999) %>% 
ggplot( aes(x=factor_artist_name,y= artist_hotttnesss, size=artist_familiarity,colour=year)) +
    geom_point(alpha=0.5) +
  scale_colour_distiller(palette="Spectral")+
  theme_bw() +
  labs(x="artist name", y="artist hotness", title="artists hotness and their familiarity")+
      theme( axis.title = element_text(size=14))

  
```

In the picture, it is very hard to find the artist and his related hotness.

using `fct_lump` function to find the top 3 artists .

```{r}
newsinger_locations4 %>% 
   arrange(artist_hotttnesss) %>% 
   mutate(factor_artist_name1 = fct_reorder(factor_artist_name, artist_hotttnesss, desc = TRUE)) %>%
  filter(artist_hotttnesss>0.6, year>1999) %>% 
  mutate(topartist_names = fct_lump(factor_artist_name1, n=3)) %>% 
ggplot( aes(x=fct_reorder(topartist_names,artist_hotttnesss),y= artist_hotttnesss, size=artist_familiarity,colour=year)) +
    geom_point(alpha=0.5) +
    scale_colour_distiller( palette="Spectral")+
theme_bw() +
  labs(x="artist name", y="artist hotness", title="artists hotness and their familiarity")+
      theme( axis.title = element_text(size=14))

   
```

In the graph we can see too much information which is not useful when I only want to find the top 3 `artists`. Therefore, I will remove the "usefulless" features `other` in the plots.

```{r}
newsinger_locations4 %>% 
   arrange(artist_hotttnesss) %>% 
   mutate(factor_artist_name1 = fct_reorder(factor_artist_name, artist_hotttnesss, desc = TRUE)) %>%
  filter(artist_hotttnesss>0.6, year>1999) %>% 
  mutate(topartist_names = fct_lump(factor_artist_name1, n=3)) %>% 
    filter(topartist_names != "Other") %>%
  droplevels() %>% 
ggplot( aes(x=fct_reorder(topartist_names,artist_hotttnesss),y= artist_hotttnesss, size=artist_familiarity,colour=year)) +
    geom_point(alpha=0.5) +
    scale_colour_distiller( palette="Spectral")+
theme_bw() +
  labs(x="artist name", y="artist hotness", title="artists hotness and their familiarity")+
      theme( axis.title = element_text(size=14))
```

Removing the `other`, which `artist` hotness are not in the top three.
From the graph above, we can easily find that "Alicia Keys" has the highest artist hotness, and she also has higher familiarity happened after 2007. And "Joe Satriani" hotness ranks three and he has the lower familiarity happened in 2000.

Try to use `multiplot` function

```{r}
 p1<-singer_locations %>%
  mutate(factor_artist_name=as_factor(artist_name))%>% 
  filter(year!=0)%>%
  droplevels() %>%
  mutate (factor_artist_name=fct_reorder(factor_artist_name, artist_hotttnesss, desc = TRUE)) %>% 
  mutate(top_artist_name = fct_lump(factor_artist_name, n=3)) %>%
  filter(top_artist_name != "Other") %>%
  select(top_artist_name,year, artist_hotttnesss) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = year, y = artist_hotttnesss, colour=top_artist_name)) + 
    geom_point(alpha=0.9)+
  theme_bw() +
    theme(axis.title = element_text(size=14))
p1

 p2<-singer_locations %>%
  mutate(factor_artist_name=as_factor(artist_name))%>% 
  filter(year!=0)%>%
  droplevels() %>%
  mutate (factor_artist_name=fct_reorder(factor_artist_name, artist_hotttnesss, desc = TRUE)) %>% 
  mutate(top_artist_name = fct_lump(factor_artist_name, n=3)) %>%
  filter(top_artist_name != "Other") %>%
  select(top_artist_name,year, artist_familiarity) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = year, y = artist_familiarity, colour=top_artist_name)) + 
    geom_point(alpha=0.9)+
     theme_bw() +
    theme(axis.title = element_text(size=14))
p2

```

Now use multiplot function.

```{r}
multiplot <- function(..., plotlist=NULL, file, cols=1, layout=NULL) {
  require(grid)

  # Make a list from the ... arguments and plotlist
  plots <- c(list(...), plotlist)

  numPlots = length(plots)

  # If layout is NULL, then use 'cols' to determine layout
  if (is.null(layout)) {
    # Make the panel
    # ncol: Number of columns of plots
    # nrow: Number of rows needed, calculated from # of cols
    layout <- matrix(seq(1, cols * ceiling(numPlots/cols)),
                    ncol = cols, nrow = ceiling(numPlots/cols))
  }

 if (numPlots==1) {
    print(plots[[1]])

  } else {
    # Set up the page
    grid.newpage()
    pushViewport(viewport(layout = grid.layout(nrow(layout), ncol(layout))))

    # Make each plot, in the correct location
    for (i in 1:numPlots) {
      # Get the i,j matrix positions of the regions that contain this subplot
      matchidx <- as.data.frame(which(layout == i, arr.ind = TRUE))

      print(plots[[i]], vp = viewport(layout.pos.row = matchidx$row,
                                      layout.pos.col = matchidx$col))
    }
  }
}
multiplot(p1,p2,cols = 2)
```

Firstly, I reorder the `artist_name` by another variable `artist_hotttnesss`. At the same time I also use `fct_lump` to found top three "artist_name".(I only focus on top 3 artist_name, and gives 8 outcomes, which means that there are some artists have the same order) Then "p1" graph compare `year` with `artist_hotttnesss` and "p2" graph compare `year` with `artist_familiarity`. Finally, I use `multiplot` to put "p1" graph and "p2" graph together.

## Writing figures to file

`ggsave` and plot again.

```{r}

ggsave("my plot.png", width=12, height=8, plot=p)

```

![plot](my plot.png)

```{r}

ggsave("my plot.pdf", width=12, height=8, plot=p)

```

![plot](my plot.pdf)

## But I want to do more!
*Make a deeper exploration of the forcats packages, i.e. try more of the factor level reordering functions.*

*Revalue a factor, e.g.:*

*Singer version: Pick a handful of locations (they are named city, try using distinct()) that you can pinpoint to a geographical place (city, region, country, continent,…). Create an excerpt of the Singer data, filtered to just those rows. Create a (couple of) new factor(s) – you pick the name(s)! – by mapping the existing city factor levels to the new (city, region, country…) levels.*
*Examples: “London, England” –> “London”, “England”, “UK”, “Europe”;*
*“Los Angeles, CA” –> “Los Angeles”, “California”, “USA”, “Americas”;...*

*“310, Louisiana” –> “New Orleans”, “Louisiana”, “USA”, “Americas”.*
*When you get tired, if you still have time on your hand, try to make this process of geolocalization more streamlined: you may want to try and use the separate function from tidyr.*

```{r}


But_I_want_do_more <- singer_locations %>%
  mutate(city= ifelse(is.na(city), "no information", singer_locations$city)) %>% 
 mutate(factor_city = as_factor(city)) 

p<- But_I_want_do_more%>%
  filter(factor_city %in% c("Oxnard, CA","Los Angeles, CA","Portland, OR","Berlin, Germany","New York, NY")) %>%
  droplevels() %>%
  mutate(cityname = fct_recode(factor_city, "Oxnard" = "Oxnard, CA", "Los Angeles" = "Los Angeles, CA", "Portland" = "Portland, OR", "Berlin" = "Berlin, Germany", "New York" = "New York, NY")) %>% 
  select(title, artist_name, city, cityname)
knitr::kable(head(p))

```

Using the `separate` function from tidyr.

```{r}
p1<- But_I_want_do_more%>%
  filter(city %in% c("Oxnard, CA","Los Angeles, CA","Portland, OR","Berlin, Germany","New York, NY")) %>%
  droplevels() %>% 
  select(title, artist_name, city)%>% 
  separate(city,c("city", "state/country"), sep = ",") 
  
knitr::kable(head(p1))
```


## Report the process.

There are two questions appear when I was doing the homework.
The first question is:

If I try to factor `year` in the `mutate` , there is an error says "no applicable method for 'as_factor' applied to an object of class "c('integer', 'numeric')"".
```
 singer_locations %>%
  mutate (factor_year = as_factor(year))
```
But when I use "typeof" to see the data type.

```{r}
typeof(singer_locations$year)
```
So I am confused about why I can not use factor `year` in `mutate` function.

The second question is:

If I want to use the `read_csv` function, the level of the `factor_artist_name` wil alsways shows unreadable code.

```{r}
write_csv(newsinger_locations_test, "reorder_singer_locations.csv")
reorder_singer_locations_csv <- read_csv("reorder_singer_locations.csv")
reorder_singer_locations_csv$factor_artist_name <- as.factor(reorder_singer_locations_csv$factor_artist_name)
head(levels(reorder_singer_locations_csv$factor_artist_name))
```

However, the right output  should be below as:

```
[1] "Motion City Soundtrack"         "Gene Chandler"                  "Paul Horn"                     
[4] "Ronnie Earl & the Broadcasters" "Dorothy Ashby"                  "Barleyjuice" 
```

In this homework,  I found very useful link:

[Be the boss of your factors](http://stat545.com/block029_factors.html);

[colors in ggplot2](http://stat545.com/block019_enforce-color-scheme.html)

This time I try to plot more graphs in the meaningful way, and I spent many times on how to use functions in the right ways. I look through the lecture very careful and try different functons in my plot. In addition, I spent a lot of time on the data processing, expecially for dealing with the "NA". In the future, I want to learn more data analysis skill.
