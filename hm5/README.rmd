Goals:

+ Reorder a factor in a principled way based on the data and demonstrate the effect in arranged data and in figures.

+ Improve a figure (or make one from scratch), using new knowledge, e.g., control the color scheme, use factor levels, smoother mechanics.
+ Implement visualization design principles.

+ Write some data to file and load it back into R. E.g., save a plot to file and include it in a R Markdown report via ![Altext](/path/to/img.png).

+ Organise your github, to celebrate the completion of STAT 545 and/or to prepare for the glorious future of STAT 547.
